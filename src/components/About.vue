    <p>The Oslo based band Why Kais debut EP “Deep Fishing” released in 2021 was described by the magazine Subjekts critic as the sprightliest debut the writer had witnessed. Since then the band has played a number of concerts in a multimedia format, where the music and the visual elements compliment each other. Led by composer and musician Kai von der Lippe, Why Kai have made a musical world based on carefully composed and evolving pieces where electronic club music becomes alive and organic when combined with acoustic instruments and playing musicians. Drummer Elias Tafjord and Kai is the rhythmical force of the band, while Jo David Lysne on guitar and Daniela Reyes on accordion gives life and color to the compositions.</p>
    <p>After two years of playing concerts and composing new pieces, Why Kais debut album is right around the corner, scheduled for release in fall 2023.</p>
